# Step Into Dockernetes

This directory contains the slides for the talk I've done on Letterbox, Docker and Kubernetes on the 7th of December,
2020.

You can see the recording ( Hungarian ) on Twitch: <https://www.twitch.tv/videos/829032854>

I'll add the YouTube link once it's up too.

In addition to the slides, you can find a ['screenplay'](screenplay.md), that I have used during presentation as a guide
on what would be the flow, what was I planning on talking about and showing.

And don't forget the [addendum](addendum.md), which contains things that I should've mentioned but didn't, and things
that I've mentioned but should've done differently.

## Compiling the slides

The slides were created for Marpit, and can be easily converted to your format of choice with the [marp
cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli).
